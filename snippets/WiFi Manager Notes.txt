To install Wifi manager from the Arduino IDE:

(beware: there is another ESP32 Wifi manager. Choose the right one).

Companion Android app to configure ESP Wifi Manager:

To setup Wifi credentials on 8266, Point your web browser to http://192.168.4.1 or http://wifi.urremote.com/

A short password seems to have unpredictable results so use one that's around 8 characters or more in length.
